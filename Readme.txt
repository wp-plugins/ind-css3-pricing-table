= How to center the table position? =
To center the table, just use center tag with the shortcode (you need to do it with the html editor of wordpress post/ page editor to do this).
Example: <center>[ind_pricingtable id="1149"]</center>.

Please note that center tag will only work for the 'Core Columns' and does not affecting the "Parent Column". So it is not recommended to center the table with the center tag when you use "Parent Column" on your table. The best practice to center the table with "Parent Column" is by specifying margin-left of div#parenttable in the css file named indshow.css inside the "css" folder of this plugin.

Empty the "Text" field and delete each "Feature's Name" field after the first field of its sort by clicking the 'x' button next to it, then leave one field blank by deleting its content and then click "Update" button.

= What should I not do? =
Please do not do the following:
- Remove "Feature" or "Feature's Name" field when there are only one kind of its sort in the form. If it is happen, then just reload the table editor.
